This folder consists of a trial run and analysis of the RED algorithm

Sequence of execution: 
1. run_last_100.py 
    - maps last 100 datapoints from weatherHistory_cleaned to their "predicted" subsequent weather pattern
    - stored in Results/last_100.json
   
2. last_100_analysis.py
    - conducts analysis on predicted results of RED algorithm mapping
    - calculates euclidean distance from "predicted" to "actual" 
    - calculates mean error and standard deviation of error
    
# Monte carlo analysis required to tell whether result is statistically significant
