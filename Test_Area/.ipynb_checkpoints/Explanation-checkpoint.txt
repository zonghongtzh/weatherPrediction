This folder consists of a trial run and analysis of the RED algorithm

Sequence of execution: 
1. run_last_100.py 
    - maps last 100 datapoints from weatherHistory_cleaned to their "predicted" subsequent weather pattern
    - stored in Results/last_100.json
   
# Monte carlo analysis required to tell whether result is statistically significant
2. monte_carlo_randomization.py
    - conducted randomized mapping 
    - allows for checking of error in a "randomized" scenario (error determined by euclidean distance from "random prediction" to "actual" results)
    - mean and standard deviation of said error will enable us to determine if RED algorithm's error is statistically significantly low enough
    
3. last_100_analysis.py
    - conducts analysis on predicted results of RED algorithm mapping for last_100 data
    - calculates euclidean distance from "predicted" to "actual" 
    - calculates mean error and standard deviation of error
    - compared to monte-carlo simulation's result to determine statistical significance
